# Getting Started

## Prerequisites

Before installing Arbiter, ensure that you have Rust installed. You can install and verify your Rust installation from the [official website](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install).

The Arbiter CLI works alongside [Foundry](https://github.com/foundry-rs/foundry) and aims to provide a similar CLI interface of setting up and interacting with Arbiter projects. Install Foundry from the [official website](https://getfoundry.sh/).
